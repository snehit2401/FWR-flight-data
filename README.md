# Design and Analysis of a Modular Flapping Wing Robot with a Swappable Powertrain Module (IEEE ICMA 2024)

Abstract—Flapping-wing robots (FWR) have domain-specific
applications, where the lack of a fast-rotating propeller makes
them safer when operating in complex environments with human
proximity. However, most existing research in flapping-wing
robots focuses on improving range/endurance or increasing payload capacity. This paper proposes a modular powertrain-based
flapping-wing robot as a versatile solution to a mission-specific
priority switch between payload or range for the same FWR. As
the flapping frequency and stroke amplitude directly influence
the flight characteristics of the FWR, we exploit this relation
when designing our swappable powertrain with different motorgearbox combinations and 4-bar crank lengths to obtain the
desired frequency and amplitude. We calculate initial estimates
for default configuration and simulate it using pterasoftware. We
then fabricate two powertrain modules - a default configuration
with a higher flapping frequency for payload purposes and an
extended-range configuration with a tandem propeller for higher
flight velocity for longer range and endurance. To verify the
results, we compare the flight test data of both power train
configurations using the same FWR platform.
